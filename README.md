# A QR based reporting application made in VUE

A very interesting concept, paste QRs on your airline / company vehicles on tarmac in airports. Any employee can open up the web app on mobile browser to scan and report issues with that vehicle. Which in turn is reported to the correct person in charge to fix the vehicle and once fixed, will put it back out to be used and change the status.
